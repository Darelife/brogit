# Brogit
More like "Broke Git", the broken version of git.
The idea behind this is to basically work out a way in situations like hackathons to properly "git" everything, while working together, with everyone getting the credit for their work, and not wasting time on merge conflicts, by using the power of the internet, to work live in sync with each other, on a single server


### Internal Monologue
Now, tell me. How would the functions work?? on a larger scale, like an abreviation of our larger tasks...i want to make a git wrapper, that can also sync with all of its users, makes a proper branch for each user, in the live versions, it will combine the lines the user worked on (if multiple users worked on a line, the user with the most characters, and then, the last user), with the dev version, and keep building it. And then, when required, using a command, they can easily merge everything, to make it all work. Maybe like if 2 people work on the same line, when we run the git stuff using brogit, we'll make those changes by pushing in the changes in 1 branch, (toposorted based on the lines sort of ...u get the point), and then, merge 2 of the branches, and then the 2nd users stuff will get added to it, and so on....before all of it, gets merged into dev, and then, they all pull from dev too. This stuff is too wild...idk what's going on really....ight, time to do `git init`.
